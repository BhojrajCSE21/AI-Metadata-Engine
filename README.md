# AI-Metadata-Engine

Kino AI is a platform that simplifies video editing with intelligent search and automatic labeling. Whether you are a Hollywood film editor, a YouTube content creator, or an indie documentarian, you can use Kino AI to find the best moments, retrieve particular scenes, and shape your story from your raw footage. Kino AIâ€™s smart tools are powered by our AI Engine, which outputs structured metadata such as scene transcriptions, visual descriptions, periods of inactivity, face tracking, and more. As a Kino Machine Learning Engineer, you will be responsible for improving the engine performance, tracking new forms of useful metadata, and collaborating with the rest of the Kino team to build an excellent product. Visit our website [here] to learn more.

Task Overview:

Given a large amount of raw HD video footage, generate useful and well-defined metadata for each video file, each distinct moment in each video file, and/or each frame in each video file.

Your task is to create a well-tested and performant AI metadata engine. You are encouraged to try many different approaches as you tackle the various types of metadata that are worth capturing. The engine should have robust I/O (many video filetypes supported, etc), be easy to monitor (report job progress via tqdm (https://github.com/tqdm/tqdm) or similar), and should output metadata in an easy-to-understand format (JSON, YAML, etc).

The Project is build to create an AI Metadata Engine for video processing and 
generate useful and well-defined metadata for each video file, each distinct
moment in each video file, and/or each frame in each video file.


Different approaches as you used to tackle the various types of metadata that are worth capturing the video data
There are lots of strange data formats and annoying “Copy of…” prefixes present in the video.
The scripts written in the program clean up that data and convert it to something useful format like .mp4!

In this project the driving-video-with-object-tracking dataset is used to obtain the video source and mot_labels.csv to generate the metadata from video used.
The Metadata Acquired from the results after processing the video are
 d = [car, trucks, bikes, peditrain ,other cars, riders, cycle]
 
The metadata generated after processing the video :-
# Total Number Of Frames
# Height and Width Of the Video
# Frame Per Second (FPS)
# Annotations and labels and transcripts of the video

The engine pulls the video into mp4 format and render the frames using pyplot for each frame.
The AI creates the the rectangle shape around each objects with differnt colors to identify them uniquely in the video.

The final functions results in the genration of video in the mp4 format and the metadata in csv file.
